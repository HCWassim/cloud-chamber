# cloud-chamber
Energy loss and straggling of alpha particles simulation in a cloud chamber. 
cloud-chamber is an algorithm designed to analyze photographs of a cloud chamber in order to identify and measure the tracks left by alpha particles. This repository provides tools to detect particle tracks, compute their lengths, and generate statistical distributions to compare with theoretical predictions.
## Features
- Automatic track detection: Identify the paths of alpha particles in cloud chamber images.

- Length measurement: Accurately measure the length of each detected track in pixels or calibrated units.

- Statistical analysis: Build frequency tables of track occurrences as a function of their lengths.

- Theoretical comparison: Includes a theoretical model to predict the expected distribution of track lengths based on energy loss calculations.
